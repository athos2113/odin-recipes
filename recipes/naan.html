                <li>1 teaspoon ghee</li>
                <li>salt as required</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pistachios</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated coconut</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon raisins</li>

            <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the book)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the all-purpose flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Add in the yogurt and enough water to make a soft dough. Knead the dough on a lightly-floured plain surface until it becomes almost elastic for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then place the dough in the bowl and cover it with a kitchen towel. Set the bowl aside in a warm place for about 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Next, prepare the filling of the naan by grinding together the coconut flakes, pistachios and raisins together in a food processor to get a coarse paste.</li>
                <li>Now, divide the doubled-up dough into six parts and roll each of the smaller dough into circles.</li>
                <li>Put a spoonful of the filling in the centre of each circle. Seal the circles by pulling the edges of them to enclose the filling in between.</li>
                <li>Place the naans on a baking tray, in a preheated 220 degree Celsius oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the naans are puffed up and have brown spots on them.</li>
                <li>Brush them with ghee before serving.</li>
            </ol>
